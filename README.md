## Overview

Langua is a suite of language tools that can be used for testing, experimentation, learning, analysis, or creation. There are several main tools: [Gen](#gen), [Morph](#morph), [Deriv](#deriv), [Frequen](#frequen), [Tree](#tree), and [Lex](#lex).

### Gen

LanguaGen is a tool for automatically building a set of words based on arbitrary rules of phonotactics. This can be used to create a dummy vocabulary for linguistic experimentation, to generate words or names for a naming language in a work of fantasy or science fiction, or as the basis for building the vocabulary of a constructed language.

### Morph

LanguaMorph is a tool for modeling historical sound change according to arbitrary rules of phonetic change.

### Deriv

LanguaDeriv is a tool for modeling word derivation based on a given list of lexemes and affixes.

### Frequen

LanguaFrequen is a tool for analyzing phoneme frequencies in a given text.

### Tree

LanguaTree is a tool for drawing and labeling syntax trees.

### Lex

LanguaLex is a tool for building a lexicon or dictionary for a language and exporting it to various formats.

## Deployment

Langua is a web-based tool built on JavaScript, and it does not use a database, so it can be installed almost anywhere without need for running a back-end server. You simply need to run the build command to build the files, then deploy to your site.

### Deployment to Subfolder /langua

If you are installing Langua in the subfolder /langua (e.g. `*.com/langua/`), all you need to do is build and deploy:

1. Download and unpack the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
1. Install the dependencies with `yarn`.
1. Build the project with `yarn build`.
1. Copy the contents of the resulting /build folder into the /langua subfolder on your server. You're done!

### Deployment to Subfolder Other than /langua

If you are installing Langua in a subfolder (e.g. `*.com/languages/`), you will need to change the basename for the router before you build the project:

1. Download and unpack the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
1. Install the dependencies with `yarn`.
1. Open `gatsby-config.js` and change `pathPrefix: &grave;/langua&grave;,` to `pathPrefix: &grave;/yoursubfolder&grave;,`.
1. Build the project with `yarn build`.
1. Copy the contents of the resulting /build folder into the appropriate subfolder on your server. You're done!

### Deployment to Root

If you are installing Langua in a website's root (e.g. a URL that ends in `.com`, `.org`, or similar):

1. Download and unpack the [latest release](../../releases/latest).
1. Install the dependencies with `yarn`.
1. Open `gatsby-config.js` and change `pathPrefix: &grave;/langua&grave;,` to `pathPrefix: &grave;&grave;,`.
1. Build the project with `yarn build`.
1. Copy the contents of the resulting /build folder into the root of your server. You're done!

## Versioning

Langua uses an unstable Master branch. The master branch is used for development, while stable versions are provided as releases. Version numbering is similar to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/); versions are listed as x.y.z., wherein z refers to bug fixes and very minor updates, y refers to minor additions and updates to functionality, and x refers to major updates or overhauls to the program that significantly impact workflow or the use of the program.

For a full list of all changes made in each version of Langua, see the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).
