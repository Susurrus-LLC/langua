        <h4 id='corpus'>Text Corpus</h4>
        <p>
          Input a corpus of text in the <strong>Text Corpus</strong> field. This
          is the text that will be analyzed. The text can be phomic or phonetic,
          or it can simply use the language&rsquo;s standard spelling system.
          For best results, however, each sound that should be analyzed
          separately will need its own grapheme or grapheme cluster. For
          example, in English, the letter <code>y</code> would need to be
          differentiated based on when it occurs as a consonant vs. when it
          occurs as a vowel. It does not matter if punctuation is removed from
          the corpus, as any graphemes not identified for analysis in the next
          step will be ignored by the tool.
        </p>
        <h4 id='phonemes'>Phonemes</h4>
        <p>
          Next, add a list of consonants and vowels accordingly to the{' '}
          <strong>Consonants</strong> and <strong>Vowels</strong> lists.
          Separate each of the segments with a forward slash (<code>/</code>
          ). These segments can be single graphemes or grapheme clusters, and a
          cluster can contain characters that are used in shorter segments. For
          example, given the corpus <code>kanto</code> and the consonants{' '}
          <code>n/t/nt</code>, the tool will identify one occurance of{' '}
          <code>nt</code>, but no occurances of <code>n</code> or <code>t</code>
          . Any graphemes not identified for analysis will be ignored. In the
          previous example, since <code>k</code> was not added to the list of
          consonants, the tool would not count its occurance.
        </p>
        <h4 id='allophones'>Allophones</h4>
        <p>
          Allophones can be added after a segment to indicate that multiple
          segments should all be counted as occurances of the same segment.
          Separate allophones with a comma (<code>,</code>
          ). For example, given the corpus <code>potaná</code>, if the vowels
          list contained <code>a/á/o</code>, the tool would identify one
          occurance each of <code>a</code>, <code>á</code>, and <code>o</code>,
          but if the vowels list contained <code>a,á/o</code>, the tool would
          identify two occurances of <code>a</code> and one occurance of{' '}
          <code>o</code>.
        </p>
        <h4 id='analysis'>Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          When ready, click the <strong>Analyze</strong> button to run the
          analysis. The tool will draw a graph and display a table showing the
          frequencies of each of the identified segments in the text corpus.
          Segments that never occur will be omitted from the graph and table.
        </p>
        <h4 id='filtering'>Filtering</h4>
        <Notice>This feature is still in development.</Notice>
        <p>
          After a text has been analyzed, the results can be filtered to show
          only certain segments. Choosing a filter will show the percentages in
          the data as it compares to only segments of that type, rather than
          comparing to all segments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the results can be filtered to show only consonants or only
          vowels. Additional filtering options will be added in the future.
        </p>
        <h4 id='files'>Saving and Loading Settings</h4>
        <p>
          Clicking the <strong>Save</strong> button will save the current
          settings to the browser’s local storage and generate a small{' '}
          <code>.lngf</code> text file containing the current settings that can
          be saved to your disk. This <code>.lngf</code> file can be loaded
          using the <strong>Open</strong> button to reload saved settings.
