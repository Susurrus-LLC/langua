	<h2>Gen</h2>
	<p>LanguaGen is a tool for automatically building a set of words based on arbitrary rules of phonotactics.</p>
	<h2>Morph</h2>
	<p>LanguaMorph is a tool for modeling historical sound change according to arbitrary rules of phonetic change. It can also be used to reverse historical sound change according to those same rules in order to guess at a word’s proto-language roots.</p>
	<h2>Deriv</h2>
	<p>LanguaDeriv is a tool for modeling word derivation according to arbitrary rules of morphosyntactics.</p>
	<h2>Frequen</h2>
	<p>LanguaFrequen is a tool for analyzing phoneme frequencies in a given text.</p>
