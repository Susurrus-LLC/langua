### Contributing Code

#### Where to begin

If you are unsure where to begin, you can search for issues tagged with `beginner` or `help wanted`. `beginner` issues are relatively easy to fix. `help wanted` issues are more involved than Beginner issues.

#### Open issues

If you want to address an open issue, please comment on the issue and state your intention to develop a solution and make a pull request. This helps prevent duplicate and conflicting work being done.

#### Work on something that doesn't have an open issue

If you want to work on something that doesn't have an open issue, please open a new issue with your intentions and a description of the changes you will make. Again, this helps prevent duplicate and conflicting work being done.

#### Local development

It is easy to work on code locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Susurrus-LLC/langua.git
cd langua
yarn
yarn start
```

This will start a virtual server running Langua at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### Pull requests

When creating a pull request, always use the [pull request template](https://github.com/Susurrus-LLC/langua/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and provide all required information along with a clear and descriptive title and any other relevant details. Do not include issue numbers in the title; *do* link to related issues in the body of the pull request. If needed, include a screenshot or animate GIF to demonstrate your changes.
